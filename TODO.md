| **Loop termination / safeguards** | For cyclic graphs, who decides when to break the loop? (e.g., max-iteration limit, convergence predicate, wall-clock timeout).                                                                    |

| **Multi-agent coordination**      | If two Agent Graphs need to cooperate (e.g., share a queue), is that out-of-scope or will you introduce a higher-level *Agent System* abstraction later?                                          |


Here are the main strengths of your high-level specification, followed by gaps or ambiguities you may want to address before dropping down into implementation choices.

## What’s already solid

| Aspect                                                                     | Why it’s strong                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core nouns** – *Agent Graph*, *Task*, *Task Execution*, *Agent Lifetime* | Gives every runtime artefact a clear identity, which is essential for tracing and persistence.                                           |
| **Directed graph with optional cycles**                                    | Explicitly admits feedback loops, something many workflow schemas gloss over.                                                            |
| **Per-edge decision logic**                                                | Lets each Task (or its result) choose the outgoing edge, supporting conditional flows without hard-coding that logic into the framework. |
| **Persistent, append-only execution state**                                | Treats every Task run as an immutable event, which keeps audit history and supports time-travel debugging.                               |
| **Async/HITL task type**                                                   | Recognises that human or long-running external interactions are first-class citizens and can pause the whole graph.                      |

## Suggested next steps

1. **Nail the contract objects** – Sketch proto/IDL for `EdgePayload`, `TaskMetadata`, `ExecutionRecord`.
2. **Write lifecycle state diagrams** – One for `TaskExecution` and one for `AgentLifetime` (including retry, pause, cancel).
3. **Define “control plane” vs “data plane”** – Even conceptually, separate orchestration decisions from user-provided computation.
4. **Draft non-functional requirements** – e.g., *must support 1 million concurrent Agent Lifetimes* or *all state writes must be idempotent*. These will inform later design trade-offs.

Addressing the items above will give you a fully specified conceptual model that’s implementation-agnostic yet detailed enough to let multiple teams build compatible runtimes.
